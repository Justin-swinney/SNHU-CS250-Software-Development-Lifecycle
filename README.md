**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

  - Asking clarifying questions in meetings with the client and development team will help an individual interpret the user’s needs and elaborate with examples to ensure you understand their needs. Creating user stories allows a developer to gain a better understanding of the goal of a new feature or update while not giving explicit instructions but allows a developer to gain an insight on the user’s goals. I would personally prefer user stories as information can get lost during a short meeting when environmental things may distract an individual attending the meeting. 

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

  - I like to approach a program by understanding the main objective of the program then proceed by planning and writing the project out in small steps that can be accomplished quickly to ensure continuous progress and keep my motivation high. I hope to incorporate a better testing step in my program development process as I tend to lack this field now.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

  - A good team member in a software development team is one who applies themselves, contributes to the team with ideas, solutions, and uplifting comments even in a time of stress. An individual who applies agile principles and commits to producing quality products with the end user and client in mind.
